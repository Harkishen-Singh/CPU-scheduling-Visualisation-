	<h1 style="text-align: center;color: green;">CPU Sheduling Algorithms</h1>
	<p>These are set of protocols or rules, by which a process is executed in a specific manner. A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uniprogramming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and CPU is free during this time. In multiprogramming systems, one process can use CPU while another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling.<br/>
		Some important terms :
		<ol>
			<li>Arrival Time:       Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.</li>
			<li>Completion Time:    Time at which process completes its execution.</li>
			<li>Burst Time:         Time required by a process for CPU execution.</li>
			<li>Turn Around Time:   Time Difference between completion time and arrival time. <br/>         
     Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time</li>
     <li>Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.<br/>
     Waiting Time = Turn Around Time - Burst Time</li>
		</ol>
